My Website

This website is going to be used for presenting my audio productions from my music to interactive art pieces.

Currently I have not uploaded any of my work, but I have added in two interactive web audio pieces which are fun to experiment with.

The first piece is called "The Virtual Cathedral" and uses the reverb functions within p5.js to make the user sonically alter a voice sample so it sounds like it is in an actual cathedral.
