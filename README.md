This website is going to be used for presenting my audio productions which could be anything from music compositions to interactive art pieces.

Currently, I have not uploaded any of my past work, but I have added two interactive web audio pieces which are fun to experiment with.

The first piece is called "The Virtual Cathedral" and uses the reverb functions within p5.js to let the user sonically alter a vocal sample. The amount of reverberation added to the sample changes depending on where the user presses (or drags) on the image of the cathedral's interior (far-left is 100% dry and far-right is 100% wet). With some experimentation, the user will easily be able to make the sound seem as though it is coming from inside an actual cathedral.

The second piece is called "Alien Abduction" which is composed of an oscillator that increases in frequency and amplitude depending on where you click the image of the UFO. If the user clicks the bottom of the image and drags their mouse up towards the top, there will be an increase in both frequency and amplitude making it sound like an alien abduction in an old film. The frequency is displayed so users can identify exactly what pure sine tones sound like at different values.

Although this site is currently under construction, I hope you enjoy what has recently been uploaded.
