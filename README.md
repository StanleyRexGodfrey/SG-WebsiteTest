My Website

This website is going to be used for presenting my audio productions from music compositions to interactive art pieces.

Currently, I have not uploaded any of my work, but I have added two interactive web audio pieces which are fun to experiment with.

The first piece is called "The Virtual Cathedral" and uses the reverb functions within p5.js to make the user sonically alter a vocal sample so it sounds like it is in an actual cathedral. The amount of reverberation will change depending on where the user presses on the image of the cathedral interior (far-left is 100% dry and far-right is 100% wet).

The second piece is called "Alien Abduction" which is an oscillator that increases in frequency and amplitude as you click higher on the image of the UFO. If the user clicks the bottom of the image and drags their mouse up towards the top, there will be a rising in both frequency and amplitude making it sound like a UFO abduction in an old film. The frequency is displayed so users can identify exactly what pure sine tones sound like at different values.

Although this site is currently under construction, I hope you enjoy what is currently here.
